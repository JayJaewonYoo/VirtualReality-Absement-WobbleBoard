# VirtualReality-Absement-WobbleBoard
Android app to create virtual reality environment and communicate with another phone to measure absement on a wobble board and reflect the basement in the virtual reality. 

## Description
One phone serving as the server is placed on a wobble board and calculates absement. The absement is sent to the client phone, acting as virtual reality simulator and raises the water level within a virtually simulated room. Encourages users to remain stable on the wobble board to prevent the water level from rising. Serves as a unique approach to exercise.
